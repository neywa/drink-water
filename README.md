# Drink Water
drink-water is a simple app for counting daily water intake. So far we have a terminal version (mostly done just to test the logic) and a desktop version.

To run the desktop version just clone the repository and run in your terminal:
~~~
# python drink_for_desktop.py
~~~
Small GUI will pop up. It's self explanatory but for convenience here are a few hints:
- Entry field is accepting values in ml.
- 'Add to pool' button adds the entry value into your daily pool.
- 'Reset pool' button empties the pool (this needs to be done every morning).
- Daily goal is se to 2500ml - it does not have any effect in the application (yet).

Next steps:
1. Make it a desktop application (done)
2. Make it a web application
3. Make it an android application
